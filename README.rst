Stamp Calculator
================

Calculates sets of postage stamps that will add up to a particular value.

This was inspired by Postcrossing, a website where users exchange postcards internationally. They almost always require international postageâ€”but the U.S. Postal Service has limited options for international stamps, so I usually try to use multiple domestic stamps instead. Postage rates change every year or so, so I thought a program like this could be helpful.
